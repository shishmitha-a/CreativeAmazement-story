Sam and his family are on their way driving to Disney World and Sam is very much thrilled with excitement that he would be able to eplore all fun stuff in Disney World. Sam's grandmother who is 
travelling along with them is already thrilled for driving along in their new Tesla car which has impressive autonomous capabilities such as the autopilot functionality that enables the car to steer, accelerate, 
and brake automatically within its lane.
Their Tesla uses its autopilot and makes its way to the Disney World parking lot. Sam's grandmother takes control of the car in order to park, she finds a spot located relatively close to the entrance and starts
to head towards it. She decides to back into the parking spot and does so successfully. They all get out of the Tesla, lock the car, and begin to head towards the front entrance.
