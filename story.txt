Sam and his family are on their way driving to Disney World and Sam is very much thrilled with excitement that he would be able to eplore all fun stuff in Disney World. Sam's grandmother who is travelling along with them is already thrilled for driving along in their new Tesla car which has impressive autonomous capabilities such as the autopilot functionality that enables the car to steer, accelerate, and brake automatically within its lane.
Their Tesla uses its autopilot and makes its way to the Disney World parking lot. Sam's grandmother takes control of the car in order to park, she finds a spot located relatively close to the entrance and starts to head towards it. She decides to back into the parking spot and does so successfully. They all get out of the Tesla, lock the car, and begin to head towards the front entrance.
Walking into Magic Kingdom, Sam looks around the area, taking in the humid Spring day. The Disney actors walked around, greeting all of the children, and their parents, enchanting them with some peculiar mood.
"This was going to be a really good day", Sam thought. They rode the rides, toured through the shops, and sat front and center for the evening firework show. Indeed, it was a very memorable day for Sam.
The first ride that Sam went on was Space Mountain. Sam had friends who had visited Disney World in the past, and they always said that this was the best ride there. He sat nest to his Grandma on the ride, and they had a blast, the entire duration of the roller coaster. Sam was not at all disappointed by his friends' recommendation.
